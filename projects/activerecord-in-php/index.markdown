# ActiveRecord In PHP
## Motiviation

I wrote this after having been spoiled by Ruby on Rails’ implementation
of the ActiveRecord pattern, while still needing to work primarily in
PHP. When I started this, there did exist some
<acronym title="Object-relational mapping">ORM</acronym> options in PHP.
However, I wasn’t satisfied with any one in particular. My goals were to
create an implementation that was very similar to the Rails syntax, easy
to install, and fast.

## Requirements

-   PHP5
-   Naming of tables and columns that follows the Rails convention.

</ul>
