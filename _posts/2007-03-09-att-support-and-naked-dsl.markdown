Lots of people like to complain about support from various large companies, particularly if the support is comcastic.  I certainly have enjoyed complaining about them from time to time.  However, today I had one of my first good experiences with AT&T's support (formerly SBC in our area).

<ol>
	<li>The line quality was good.  No static making it hard to hear the support people.</li>
	<li>Relatively short wait on hold.</li>
	<li>The people I talked to spoke English in such a way that I could easily understand them.  One even had a charming southern accent.</li>
	<li>I received useful information the first time I asked for it.</li>
</ol>

I also discovered that AT&T now offers naked DSL or as they call it "dry-loop DSL".  In other words, they allow you to purchase DSL without requiring you to have phone service through them.  I had heard mention of this happening in the future, but didn't realize it was already available.

Unfortunately if you remove your phone service, your DSL no longer qualifies for whatever special offers they have, which means you'll be paying more for your DSL.  So, despite removing phone service, your bill may not decrease by all that much.  The support folk informed me that if I were to switch to dry-loop DSL, they have to shut of my phone <strong>AND</strong> DSL prior to turning on the dry-loop DSL.  I was told that I might be DSL-less for up to 5 business days.  Surprisingly, the support person was apologetic about this issue.

<strong>Dry Loop DSL Options from AT&T</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Express: 1.5 Mbps / 384 Kbps -- $44.99</li>
	<li>Pro: 3.0 Mbps / 512 Kbps -- $49.99</li>
</ol>

To talk directly to the dry-loop folk at AT&T, call 1-888-800-4095 (7am - 9pm M-F; 8am - 5pm Saturday).
