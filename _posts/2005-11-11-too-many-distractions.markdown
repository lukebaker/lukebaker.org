  <p>I seem to get easily distracted or at least quickly intrigued by new things. It seems that having a constant urge of wanting to learn and understand new ideas and objects has its drawbacks. It seems lately that my personal projects get stopped because I go off and dive into some other completely different topic.</p>   <p>For example, my current Google Maps project is getting side-lined by things like:<br />  </p> <ul>     <li>wanting to have a solid grasp of how various hash algorithms work</li>       <li>wanting to fully understand FastCGI and SCGI and their inner-workings<br />     </li>       <li>watching a <a href="http://norfolk.cs.washington.edu/htbin-post/unrestricted/colloq/details.cgi?id=437" title="BigTable Google talk at University of Washington">very interesting Google talk about BigTable</a></li>       <li>from that talk being introduced into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter" title="Wikipedia article on Bloom filters">Bloom filters</a> and wanting to explore those more</li>   </ul>  <p> Maybe if I blog about the problem, it'll leave me...  Do I even want that?</p>
