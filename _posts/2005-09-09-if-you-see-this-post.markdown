<p>If you see this post, then the move to <a href="http://textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a> was successful. I also upgraded to WordPress version 1.6-ALPHA-2-still-dont-use. So far it looks nice, I haven't had any problems with it. There's now a WYSIWYG (<a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">tinyMCE</a>) for editing and creating posts. The admin area has been prettied up with all sorts of Ajax effects / interfaces. One of the reasons I upgraded to using the latest version out of subversion was so that I could upgrade as easily as <a href="http://photomatt.net/2005/05/09/new-wordpress/">the upgrade procedure Matt bragged about.</a> Hopefully I don't shoot myself in the foot with it, though. <img src="/wordpress/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" /></p><p> Let me know if you spot any broken things on my site. I didn't port over the gallery, and I don't plan to. I plan to use flickr for my photo storing / gallery needs.  Any request for lukebaker.org/gallery will be redirected to the gallery on my 1and1 site, however that site won't exist in a year.<br /> </p>
