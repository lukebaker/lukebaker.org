So, Mandy and I signed the lease for the apartment that we'll be moving into after we get married. We're pretty excited about it. It seems like a really nice place. It's in Comstock Park. So, it's pretty close to the highways (I-96, I-196, US-131). After we signed the lease yesterday we took a few <a href="http://s89626553.onlinehome.us/gallery/new_apt/">pictures</a> of the complex.  <a href="http://s89626553.onlinehome.us/gallery/new_apt/">Take a look...</a>  Unfortunately, the comments on the pictures are hard to read (gray on black).  Hopefully I'll fix that at some point.
