I've been meaning to release this code for quite some time.  I've finally had a bit of time and motivation to sit down and take care of it.  Ever since I started working with Ruby on Rails, I would cringe whenever I had to write yet more PHP code to do simple <acronym title="Create Retrieve Update Delete">CRUD</acronym> actions.  Furthermore I really enjoyed the Rails syntax that you use to interact with its implementation of the ActiveRecord pattern.  As such, I went forward and built a clone using PHP5.  So far it has been used for a few projects and has been a joy to use.

Props to my employer, <a href="http://www.gospelcommunications.org/">Gospel Communications</a>, who allowed me to spend some time on this during work hours, as well as give me full copyright of the code.

More information and documentation over on the <a href="/projects/activerecord-in-php/">project's home page.</a>
