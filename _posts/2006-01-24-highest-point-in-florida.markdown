According to <a href="http://geology.com/state-high-points.shtml">geology.com</a>, the highest point in Florida is a whopping 345 feet.  Britton Hill is less than a mile from the Florida-Alabama border.  In my neck of the woods, everyone said that <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/local/12203376.htm">Mount Trashmore</a> was the highest point in Miami-Dade County.  However, Britton Hill is almost 3 times as high as Mount Trashmore! (via <a href="http://digg.com/">digg.com</a>)
