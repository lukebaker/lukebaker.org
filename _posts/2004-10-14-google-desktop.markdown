Folks have been talking about a Google browser, but I didn't really see what would be so great about it.  After reading a <a href="http://www.nutch.org/blog/2004/10/personal-web-platform.html">thought provoking post,</a> I had a hunch that this is really where Google is going.  I was primarily thinking about personal desktop search, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Google move in the direction that Doug mentions.  Just a couple days ago I was at a seminar by a Google employee.  Someone asked about if Google is doing anything with desktop search.  The presenter either didn't understand the question, didn't have a clue, or was a really good actor because he gave no indication that they were moving in this direction.  <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Enter Google Desktop.</a>
