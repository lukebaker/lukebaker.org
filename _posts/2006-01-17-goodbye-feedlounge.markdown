For the past 6 months I've been an alpha tester using <a title="FeedLounge Homepage" href="http://feedlounge.com/">FeedLounge</a> exclusively as my feed reader.  I've been fairly satisfied with it, but this past week I've been weening myself off of it and moving to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google's Reader.</a>  Today marks the first day that I didn't have a "FeedLounge tab" in my browser.  I moved away from FeedLounge for 2 reasons:
<ol>
	<li>I'm cheap.</li>
	<li>I'm not a power user.</li>
</ol>
The original plan for FeedLounge was to offer free accounts and paid accounts.  I was hopeful that my needs would be met by a free account.  However, it was <a href="http://feedlounge.com/blog/2005/12/05/state-of-feedlounge/">recently stated</a> that they'd initially be offering only paid accounts.  IOW, I'd have to pay for the service come March 16th if they didn't come up with a way to offer free accounts by that time.  True to my Dutch roots, I had a hard time coming up with a good reason to pay for this service.

Finally, it turns out I'm not a power user, which FeedLounge touts as its target user.  I subscribe to about 60 feeds.  I originally thought that I'd use the nifty tagging features in FeedLounge.  It turns out I didn't.  Most of the time, all I want to do is go through all my unread items, and perhaps occasionally mark an item to come back to later.  Google Reader meets these simple needs.
