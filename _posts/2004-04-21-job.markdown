I got a job!  I've been working at <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/">gospelcom.net</a> for about 4 months now. It started out as a 6 month position, and they said they'd tell me after 4 months whether or not they would be able to extend my position. Well, yesterday they offered me a job. A real job. It's been fun so far and I don't expect it to stop any time soon. I'm pretty stoked about it. In other news, I'm starting to look at customizing my site a tad.
