Wow, go me! I managed to dork up my site for awhile. :-/ Well I updated my Gmail greasemonky script to work properly even when changing between multiple Gmail accounts. Gmail changed something awhile ago, and I was slow to update the version on the site. It's <a href="{{site.url}}/upload/powergmail.user.js">there now.</a>
