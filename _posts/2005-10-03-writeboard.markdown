<a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a> released yet another <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/">web application</a> today.  For an overview I'd recommend <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/writeboard_is_live.php">their blog post</a> and <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/tour/">the tour</a>.  The "oh-that's-cool-and-could-be-useful-in-lots-places" part of Writeboard would have to be the different size circles beside each revision.  On the list of revisions they show a circle, which depending on its size tells the user how drastic of a change each revision was.  See #4 of <a href="http://www.writeboard.com/tour/">the tour.</a><br />
