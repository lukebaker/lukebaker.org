Man, I wish they had <a href="http://webapps.calvin.edu/knightcite/">this citation creation tool</a> when I was at <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/">Calvin</a>.  I hated having to always lookup in a book how to cite something for a bibliography.  This looks like a fairly flexible and comprehensive tool.  Good Going Justin 'Juice' Searls!  (No I don't know him, but he's got a great nickname!)
