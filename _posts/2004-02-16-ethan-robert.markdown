<a href="http://s89626553.onlinehome.us/gallery/indy_album/SSCN0409">Ethan Robert Baker</a> was born to Jonathan and Janna Baker on Friday February the 13th at 11:18am. He weighed in at 8 lbs. and 1 oz. He was 20 3/4 inches long. Being born on Friday the 13th, I was hoping they would name him <a href="http://www.fridaythe13thfilms.com/home.html">Freddy or Jason</a>.  No such luck.  Fortunately, they did at least go with the name "Bobby" for the middle name.
