<p>I just got an invite to <a href="http://measuremap.com/">Measure Map</a>.  It's a hosted stats solution that's directed specifically at blogs, developed by the people at <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a>.  <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/index.html">Jeff Veen</a> gave a demo of it at <a href="http://gospelcon.com/">Gospelcon</a> this year.  It looks like it is an interesting use of Ajax, including Flash where appropriate.  Now all I need is for people to actually read the blog and generate some stats.</p>
