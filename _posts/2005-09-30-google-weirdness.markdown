<p>I recently noticed something quite odd.  Apparently the Google <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagerank">PageRank</a> for www.lukebaker.org is significantly higher than the PageRank of lukebaker.org.  </p><p><a href="http://www.mygooglepagerank.com/pagerank.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lukebaker.org%2F&PRcode=%3Ca+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mygooglepagerank.com%22+target%3D%22_blank%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mygooglepagerank.com%2FPRimage.php%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.lukebaker.org%2F%22+border%3D%220%22+width%3D%2266%22+height%3D%2213%22+alt%3D%22Google+PageRank%26trade%3B+-+Post+your+PR+with+MyGooglePageRank.com%22%3E%3C%2Fa%3E%3Cnoscript%3E%3Ca+href%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mygooglepagerank.com%27+title%3D%27My+Google+Page+Rank%27%3EMy+Google+Page+Rank%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fnoscript%3E">PageRank for www.lukebaker.org: 7</a><br /> <a href="http://www.mygooglepagerank.com/pagerank.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Flukebaker.org%2F&PRcode=%3Ca+href%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mygooglepagerank.com%22+target%3D%22_blank%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mygooglepagerank.com%2FPRimage.php%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.lukebaker.org%2F%22+border%3D%220%22+width%3D%2266%22+height%3D%2213%22+alt%3D%22Google+PageRank%26trade%3B+-+Post+your+PR+with+MyGooglePageRank.com%22%3E%3C%2Fa%3E%3Cnoscript%3E%3Ca+href%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mygooglepagerank.com%27+title%3D%27My+Google+Page+Rank%27%3EMy+Google+Page+Rank%3C%2Fa%3E%3C%2Fnoscript%3E">PageRank for lukebaker.org: 4<br /> </a></p><p>Of course we all know my site doesn't deserve a PageRank of 7. I investigated a little by using Google's link: operator. It turned up some really interesting results.</p><p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Awww.lukebaker.org">Sites that link to www.lukebaker.org</a> <br /> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Alukebaker.org">Sites that link to lukebaker.org</a></p><p>The weird part is all those gospelcom.net pages that apparently link to my site. I have no clue why they would have ever linked to me. They certainly don't appear to currently link to my site. Also, Yahoo!'s newly released tool doesn't show any gospelcom.net pages linking to either <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=http%3A%2F%2Flukebaker.org&bwmf=s&bwm=i">lukebaker.org</a> or <a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/search?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lukebaker.org&bwmf=s&bwm=i">www.lukebaker.org</a>.  Any ideas?<br /> </p>
