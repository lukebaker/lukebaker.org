I switched over to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.</a>  I figured I didn't need to use <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Moveable Type.</a>  WordPress looks like it has everything I'd want, plus they're completely open source.  Like I mentioned before, there is a chance I'll customize this site a bit.  It'd be nice to at least not have default colors :-)  I'll also probably be trying out some of the cool plugins available for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.</a>  It'd be really nice to have a image gallery integrated into WordPress and do away with Gallery.  It looks like there are a few out there that do something like this.  Maybe later I'll go more into how I think this sort of thing should work and why I want it.
